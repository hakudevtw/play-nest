- Entities
  - TypeORM creates repositories based on the entities, no need to set up your self
  - Steps
    - Create entity file, create class in it and list all the properties entity should have
    - Connect entity to parent module, this creates a repository
    - Connect entity to the root connection (in app module)
- [Repository API](https://www.typeorm.io/#/repository-api)
  - create - makes a new instance of an entity, but does not persist it to the DB
  - save - Adds or updates record to the DB
  - find - runs a query and returns a list of entities
  - findOne - runs a query, returns the first record matching the search criteria
  - remove - remove a record from DB
